# NEISS Analytics

In my spare time I will do some analytics projects using public data just for fun, this NEISS Analytics is one of them.  


CPSCâ€™s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) is a national probability sample of hospitals in the U.S. and its territories. Patient information is collected from each NEISS hospital for every emergency visit involving an injury associated with consumer products.
